# Using data science to predict landing success of falcon 9 first stage

This project is the applied data science capstone project which is part of the [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science?utm_medium=sem&utm_source=gg&utm_campaign=b2c_emea_ibm-data-science_ibm_ftcof_professional-certificates_arte_feb_24_dr_geo-multi_sem_rsa_gads_lg-all&campaignid=21031895959&adgroupid=164650320608&device=c&keyword=ibm%20professional%20data%20science%20certificate&matchtype=p&network=g&devicemodel=&adposition=&creativeid=691069049184&utm_term={}&hide_mobile_promo&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwl4yyBhAgEiwADSEjeL5TLr7BHSSKJ_VrIyjalRbk3FwIlK1Yy25ndTYvGRPgR5M_4z0uVRoCkvUQAvD_BwE) hosted on Coursera. The capstone comprises a 5-month (200 h) program teaching python for data science, data visualization, SQL, and introduction to machine learning with python (see certificate [here](https://coursera.org/share/5db5e11354047e8c326e1be385101e78)). The course awarded me with a great foundation to continue my journey of deepening my data science skills.

## Rationale:
The cost of rocket launches is majorly influenced by reusage of the first stage. Thus, via predicting a successful landing of the first stage, companies are enabled to reduce costs.

## Research Objective:
This project attempts to identify the factors for a successful first stage landing of SpaceXâ€™ Falcon 9 rocket via:
- collecting data using SpaceX REST API and webscraping methods
- wrangle data to create success/fail outcome variable
- explore data with SQL and data visualization techniques
- predict landing outcome via several machine learning techniques
  
## Results:
Significantly landing success-influencing factors are launching success, landing sites and orbits. In detail, launching success increased over time and launch site KSC LC-39A has the highest success rate among landing sites. Additionally, orbits (ES-L1, GEO, HEO, SSO) have a 100 % success rate.
