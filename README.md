# Using data science to predict landing success of falcon 9 first stage

This project is the applied data science capstone project which is part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate hosted on Coursera. 

## Rationale:
The cost of rocket launches is majorly influenced by reusage of the first stage. Thus, via predicting a successful landing of the first stage, companies are enabled to reduce costs.

## Research Objective:
This project attempts to identify the factors for a successful first stage landing of SpaceXâ€™ Falcon 9 rocket via:
- collecting data using SpaceX REST API and webscraping methods
- wrangle data to create success/fail outcome variable
- explore data with SQL and data visualization techniques
- predict landing outcome via several machine learning techniques
  
## Results:
Significantly landing success-influencing factors are launching success, landing sites and orbits. In detail, launching success increased over time and launch site KSC LC-39A has the highest success rate among landing sites. Additionally, orbits (ES-L1, GEO, HEO, SSO) have a 100 % success rate.
